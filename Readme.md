#### Description
Wordpress plugin.
This plugin allows visitors to report posts, pages and comments for broken links, misleading or abusive contents, copyright infringements or any other reason, simply and quickly.
A link to report content expands to a form for submitting reports.
The Wordpress administrator can choose to receive email notifications when a report is submitted, and reports can be archived or deleted in the Wordpress site's Dashboard area.  

The plugin was originally authored by Rajeevan (http://ww2.rjeevan.com). 
Mike Kelly updated it for compatibility with Wordpress 3.5, including multisite installations, and added the capability to report comments.
